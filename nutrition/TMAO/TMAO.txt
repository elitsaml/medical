        Trimethylamine N-Oxide = TMAO

    ------------------------------------

Definition:
    Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is a molecule generated from choline, betaine, and carnitine via gut microbial metabolism.

    Inhibitors:
        3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol (DMB), inhibits microbiotal choline TMA lyase
