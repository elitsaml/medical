* Interstitial Fluid - Fluid which surraunds all our cells.
    11 Liter Interstitial Fluid and 5 Liter Blood.
    Blood is in the vescle and throught the interstetial fluid goas to the cells.
    The Interstitial Fluid goes then to the lyph vescle and then to the blood.
    It looks like the plasma inside the blood.

* Intertitium  - 1/6 of the human body volume - the space between 2 cells filled by interstitium fluid:
    - collagen fiber - very tick and long
    - protioglycon filaments - small twisted and coiled
        - Hyloronic Acid - 98%
        - Proteins - 2%
    The cells are ankerd with this types of fibre,

    Plasma leaking from the endotilium walls to othe intersitium. 
    The fluid goes in the proteoglxton filaments making the prosess of diffusion (difuse the nutrient into the interstitium) and the:
    - tissue gel (help the diffusion of the molecules of nutrient)

    - free fluid -  because is not intrapt in the protioglicon filaments and it is moving freely in the interstitium
        // - free fluid vesicle
        // - "streams of fluid" - long rivlets
    // in patological conditions as adema they increase. Amount of fluits from the capilaries increases.


Ex: oxigen from the red blood cells to the plasma to the intersitial fluid into the cells and mitochonrien
